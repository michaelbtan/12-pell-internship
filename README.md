# 12-pell-internship

The 12Pell Intern and Mentorship app is a platform for youth interns in the local community to find mentors through our network. 

## Mentors

Mentors signup for the site on the site with a bio talking about their career and what they have to offer. They are able to post multiple listings describing their proposed internship program. Members associated with the commnity are able to give the mentors recommendations, ratings, and upvotes to validate their credentials.

## Interns

Youth interns will eventually be able to apply for access to the site with a resume, and bio. 

## Technology

The backend is built using Django with a postgres database. The frontend is built with react and deployed on netlify.
